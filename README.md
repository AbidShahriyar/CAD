# CAD
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a major type of heart disease that causes large number of deaths around the globe. Timely, accurate prognosis of this complication can forestall early demise of patients. Invasive coronary angiography, the principal diagnosis modality of CAD is a fairly complicated, time consuming, costly and risky process. This study builds a machine learning ensemble classifier to predict CAD from non-invasive tests and demographic characteristics of patients with 86% f1 score, 86% precision and 85% recall. Model explainability tools have been used for analyzing the modelâ€™s behavior and ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest is found to be the most dominating feature for classification
